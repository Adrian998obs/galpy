Adding a potential to the C integrator
--------------------------------------

1) Implement the potential in a .c file under potential_src/potential_c_ext. Look at potential_src/potential_c_ext/LogarithmicHaloPotential.c for the right format

2) Add your new potential to potential_src/potential_c_ext/galpy_potentials.h

3) Edit the code under orbit_src/orbit_c_ext/integratePlanarOrbit.c to set up your new potential (in the 'leapfrog' function)

4) Edit the code in orbit_src/integratePlanarOrbit.py to set up your new potential

5) Finally, add 'self.hasC= True' to the initialization of the potential in question (after the initialization of the super class)

6) It should work now!
