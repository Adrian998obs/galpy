Dynamical modeling of tidal streams
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

galpy contains tools to model the dynamics of tidal streams, making
extensive use of action-angle variables. As an example, we can model
the dynamics of the following tidal stream (that of Bovy 2014; ). This
movie shows the disruption of a cluster on a GD-1-like orbit around
the Milky Way:

The blue line is the orbit of the progenitor cluster and the black
points are cluster members. The disruption is shown in an approximate
orbital plane and the movie is comoving with the progenitor cluster.
